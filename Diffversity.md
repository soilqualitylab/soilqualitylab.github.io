AZYCNH workflows involve constanting leveling up one's skills in a self-starting, [autodidactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) fashion.

Diffversity is in the knowledge engineering business. We work at developing the components of the toolchain for an individual's knowledge engineering processes ... in order help us all ACCELERATE our LEARN PROCESSES.

The POINT of wanting LEARN better is about being able to accomplish better results faster ... so that we are able to be more present, to listen better, to be more empathetic, to ask better questions and to HELP OTHERS as they make better decisions in their lives.

## ACCELERATED IMMERSION defines the DIFFVERSITY LEARNING PROCESS

Our self-starting, [autodidactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) approach to lifelong education is about taking full responsibility for learning better, learning more rapidly. Thinking DIFFERENT about education is about preparing for a world [or multi-dimensional battlefield] characterized by even more rapid technological change.

In a nutshell, the ***Diffversity approach*** all about continually gathering the most current intelligence and knowledge, making sense of it all and then predictively looking forward intuitively to see what the DIFFERENCE-MAKING technologies will be that overcome our current constraints ... to re-shape the technology that matters in the Universe around us.

It's probably best to start with an example ... consider the highly intuitive, but seemingly preposterous claim that ***working in the realm of [cognitive radio (CR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_radio) for [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot) [real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing) [fault tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) [swarm robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics) is actually a means of training for meditative awareness.***  

*Yeah, that's OBVIOUSLY a* ***total stretch*** ... **AGREED!**... but let's **think** about how that system might function in a chaotic battlefield environment ... and what that kind of [CR or cognitive-optimized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_radio) chaotic communication environment of multi-plexed RF signals from/for multiple devices transmitting/recieving, each message packet containing some important portion of a fact ... **THINK** about ***thinking*** about different cogitive CR strategies used in that comms problem might change our mind awareness and attention spans in chaotic times ... 

We can see that **Diffversity** is really about being overwhelmed ... in other words, it's about the [hormesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis) of mental or cognitive [dose-response relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose%E2%80%93response_relationship) ... pushing the DIFFERENCES beyond our normal boundaries ... is about developing our ***think-outside-the-box*** mental *muscles* ... it's [accelerating our stress screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_accelerated_stress_audit) to understand our ability to [perform at a high level of quality under stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing) ... nobody ***loses their religion*** when they are not stressed OR when they preaching to the choir [for show] ... we all know, the nasty side comes out when people get stressed or pushed to far or step on a Lego in the dark when they unable to sleep because they're facing financial ruin.

**Diffversity** is really about training ourselves [to develop capabilities we didn't know we had] by being overwhelmed.

**Diffversity** is based the idea that we can learn to think better by immersing ourselves in the most difficult, challenging, complex and HARD problems that we can find ... but we probably *learn best* when we can do so in a manner in which we can be relatively sure that we'll survive the difficulty, ie it doesn't really advance our cause to have everyone DIE from the learning experience ... troubleshooting issues to understand how systems respond will be HARD, but it has to a very PRACTICAL and HANDS-ON experience ... because *learning to think* about frustrating problems helps us to be more present, more empathetic, more aware and more focused.

## How we learn IMMERSIVELY is the key to how we WILL think

*We should never stop learning IMMERSIVELY ...* ... in fact we should accelerate the plunge in [immersive learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_learning) so that a portion of our brain is continually in that mode of learning how to speak, to hear, what to watch and how we learned to THINK and be aware of our cognitive strategies in our [first] ***native language***.

Consider the following proposed 200-module training regimen [given below] for a year-long deep plunge *off the deeper sort of deep ends* into [learning to ***think like a native*** in the Rust programming language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) with a focus on developing programming capabilities and toolchains for working in [predictive fault-tolerance in real-time operating systems [RTOS] for swarm robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09309.pdf) which might include developing the capability to [incorporate the latest thinking research to optimize cognitive radio](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22cognitive+radio%22&searchtype=all&source=header) for RT-FT swarm robotics.

Per the ORIGINAL PLAN for our immersive learning plunge, the modules almost appear to be designed to progressively build skills, starting with Rust fundamentals, then moving into lower-level systems concepts crucial for RTOS development, followed by a deeper plunge into embedded and real-time modules that dive deeper into the specifics of constrained environments and deterministic execution ...

***EXCEPT*** this is immersive training that gets more progressively immersive, so we're certainly not going to just STICK WITH the original plan ... we live in an AI-enabled age, so we are going to try to learn by IMMERSION ... that means trying to skim over and grok the entire syllabus in a week or a couple weeks or maybe a month at most ... but we are going to drink from the firehose.

*Of course, it's perfectly okay to revise/extend the syllabus as we go along BUT ...*

## THE ORIGINAL SYLLABUS BRINGS US BACK TO CENTER ...

At some point, when we have really squeezed all the just out of the ol' lemon, we are going to ask our AI assistant an UPDATED VERSION of our original question to furnish us with a new, improved, updated syllabus *although we will keep the old one for reference*.

    "Please develop a 200 module training regimen for a year-long deep dive into learning to program with Rust-Lang, including WASM, the Tauri application toolkit, ROS2 with Rust bindings and other intracies of Rust-Lang and getting closer to the machine. The general objective for this year-long training regimen should be in the realm of developing the capabilities and toolchain for developing fault-tolerant real-time operating systems for swarm robotics."

The POINT of [this learning exercise](https://cloudkernelos.github.io/template/2024/03/01/00.01.00-real-time-fault-tolerance.html) is IMMERSION ... and overwhelming ourselves with a progressively better understanding of the topic ... in order to be able to ask progressively better questions ... to ***ACCELERATE the DIFFERENCE!!!***
