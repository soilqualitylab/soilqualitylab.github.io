# Chapter 2 -- The 50-Day Plan For Building A Personal Assistant Agentic System (PAAS)

The BIG REASON to build a PAAS is for radically improved intelligence gathering.

We do things like this to avoid being a mere spectator passively consuming content and to instead actively engage in intelligence gathering ... dogfooding the toolchain and workflow to accomplish this and learning how to do it is an example of what it means to stop being a spectator and actively engage in AI-assisted intelligence gathering.

## Preparation For The 50 Days

Review these BEFORE starting; develop your own plan for each

### [Milestones](nested/sub-chapter_2.A.md)

Look these over ... and if you don't like the milestones, then you can certainly revise **your** course with **your** own milestones per **your** desired expectations that make more sense for **your** needs.

#### Phase 1: Complete Foundation Learning & Rust/Tauri Environment Setup (End of Week 2)

By the end of your first week, you should have established a solid theoretical understanding of agentic systems and set up a complete development environment with Rust and Tauri integration. This milestone ensures you have both the conceptual framework and technical infrastructure to build your PAAS.

**Key Competencies:**

1. **Rust Development Environment**
2. **Tauri Project Structure** 
3. **LLM Agent Fundamentals**
4. **API Integration Patterns**
5. **Vector Database Concepts**

#### Phase 2: Basic API Integrations And Rust Processing Pipelines (End of Week 5)

By the end of your fifth week, you should have implemented functional integrations with several key data sources using Rust for efficient processing. This milestone ensures you can collect and process information from different sources, establishing the foundation for your intelligence gathering system. You will have implemented integrations with all target data sources and established comprehensive version tracking using Jujutsu. This milestone ensures you have access to all the information your PAAS needs to provide comprehensive intelligence.

**Key Competencies:**

1. **GitHub Monitoring**
2. **Jujutsu Version Control**
3. **arXiv Integration**
4. **HuggingFace Integration**
5. **Patent Database Integration**
6. **Startup And Financial News Tracking**
7. **Email Integration**
8. **Common Data Model**
9. **Rust-Based Data Processing**
10. **Multi-Agent Architecture Design**
11. **Cross-Source Entity Resolution**
12. **Data Validation and Quality Control**

#### Phase 3: Advanced Agentic Capabilities Through Rust Orchestration (End of Week 8)

As we see above, by the end of your fifth week, you will have something to build upon. From week six on, you will build upon the core agentic capabilities of your system and add advanced agentic capabilities, including orchestration, summarization, and interoperability with other more complex AI systems. The milestones of this third phase will ensures your PAAS can process, sift, sort, prioritize and make sense of the especially vast amounts of information that it is connected to from a variety of different sources. It might yet be polished or reliable at the end of week 8, but you will have something that is close enough to working well, that you can enter the homestretch refining your PAAS.

**Key Competencies:**

1. **Anthropic MCP Integration**
2. **Google A2A Protocol Support**
3. **Rust-Based Agent Orchestration**
4. **Multi-Source Summarization** 
5. **User Preference Learning**
6. **Type-Safe Agent Communication**

#### Phase 4: Polishing End-to-End System Functionality with Tauri/Svelte UI (End of Week 10)

In this last phase, you will be polishing and improving the reliability what was basically a functional PAAS, but still had issues, bugs or components that needed overhaul. In the last phase, you will be refining of what were some solid beginnings of an intuitive Tauri/Svelte user interface. In this final phase, you will look at different ways to improve upon the robustness of data storage and to improve the efficacy of your comprehensive monitoring and testing. This milestone represents the completion of your basic system, which might still not be perfect, but it should be pretty much ready for use and certainly ready for future ongoing refinement and continued extensions and simplifications.

**Key Competencies:**

1. **Rust-Based Data Persistence**
2. **Advanced Email Capabilities**
3. **Tauri/Svelte Dashboard**
4. **Comprehensive Testing**
5. **Cross-Platform Deployment**
6. **Performance Optimization**

### [Daily Workflow](nested/sub-chapter_2.B.md)

Develop your own daily workflow, the course is based on a 3-hr morning routine and a 3-hr afternoon routine, with the rest of your day devoted to homework and trying to keep up with the pace. If this does not work for you -- then revise your course per your course with expectations that make sense for you.

### [Autodidacticism](nested/sub-chapter_2.C.md)

Develop your own best practices, methods, approaches for your own autodidactic strategies, if you have not desire to become an autodidact, the course this kind of thing is clearly not for you or other low-agency people who require something resembling a classroom.

### [Communities](nested/sub-chapter_2.D.md)

Being an autodidact will assist you in developing your own best practices, methods, approaches for your own ways of engaging with 50-100 communities that matter. From a time management perspective, your will mostly need to be a hyperefficient lurker.

You can't fix most stupid comments or cluelessness, so be extremely careful about wading into discussions. Similarly, you should try not to be the stupid or clueless one. Please do not expect others to explain every little detail to you. Before you ask questions, you need to assure that you've done everything possible to become familiar with the vibe of the community, ie ***lurk first!!!*** AND it is also up to YOU to make yourself familiar with [pertinent papers](nested/sub-chapter_2.E.md), [relevant documentation](nested/sub-chapter_2.F.md), [trusted or classic technical references](nested/sub-chapter_2.G.md) and [everything about your current options are in the world of computational resources](nested/sub-chapter_2.H.md).

### [Papers](nested/sub-chapter_2.E.md)

READ more, improve your reading ability with automation and every trick you can think of ... but READ more and waste less time watching YouTube videos.

### [Documentation](nested/sub-chapter_2.F.md)

It's worth repeating for emphasis, READ more, improve your reading ability with automation and every trick you can think of ... but READ more and work on your reading ... so that you can stop wasting time watching YouTube videos.

### [References](nested/sub-chapter_2.G.md)

It's worth repeating for EXTRA emphasis, READ a LOT more, especially read technical references ... improve your reading ability with automation and every trick you can think of ... but READ more and stop wasting any time watching YouTube videos.

### [Big Compute](nested/sub-chapter_2.H.md)

You cannot possibly know enough about your options in terms of computational resources, but for Pete's sake, stop thinking that you need to have a monster honking AI workstation sitting on your desk. **BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE WITH RENTABLE BIG COMPUTE** and that includes observability, monitoring and trace activities to examine how well you are utilizing compute resources in near realtime.
